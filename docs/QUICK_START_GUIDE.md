4. **Re-upload game code**
5. **Test each token** - should display correct country name

### Step 3: Challenge Cards (30 minutes)  
1. **Print challenge cards** on cardstock
2. **Cut to playing card size** (2.5" x 3.5")
3. **Apply small RFID stickers** to corners
4. **Scan and record UIDs**
5. **Update challenge database** in code

### Step 4: Final Programming Test (15 minutes)
1. **Upload complete game** with all correct UIDs
2. **Test each token** - should display country and stats
3. **Test each challenge** - should load correctly
4. **Verify game flow** - challenge ‚Üí tokens ‚Üí reveal

**Success Criteria:** All tokens and challenges recognized by name

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 4: Game Board (Sunday Morning)

### Step 1: Board Layout (30 minutes)
1. **Cut foam board** to 12" x 16"
2. **Mark ranking positions** 1-8 with pencil
3. **Cut RFID scanner hole** 4" x 3" in center
4. **Mark token storage areas** around edges

### Step 2: Component Mounting (45 minutes)
1. **Mount Arduino underneath** board (tape or hot glue)
2. **Position RFID reader** in scanner hole
3. **Secure speaker** under board for best sound projection
4. **Route power bank cable** cleanly to side

### Step 3: Finishing Touches (30 minutes)
1. **Add position labels** - print numbers 1-8 on small circles
2. **Create instruction card** - basic gameplay steps
3. **Make token holders** - small circles or indentations
4. **Test component access** - ensure everything reachable

### Step 4: Final Assembly Test (15 minutes)
1. **Power on complete system**
2. **Test RFID reading** through board material
3. **Check speaker volume** and clarity
4. **Verify all tokens scan** reliably from gameplay position

**Success Criteria:** Complete system works as intended, professional appearance

## üéÆ Phase 5: First Gameplay (Sunday Afternoon)

### Gameplay Test Protocol

#### Test 1: Basic Flow (15 minutes)
1. **Scan GDP challenge card** - should load challenge
2. **Scan 3 country tokens** in order - should confirm each
3. **Scan challenge card again** - should start reveal sequence
4. **Watch automated reveal** - should show correct/incorrect for each position

#### Test 2: Different Challenge (10 minutes)
1. **Try population challenge** 
2. **Use different tokens**
3. **Verify correct ordering** matches expected results

#### Test 3: Error Handling (10 minutes)
- **Scan unknown card** - should give error message
- **Scan same token twice** - should reject duplicate
- **Try to start without challenge** - should prompt for challenge

#### Test 4: Family/Friend Test (15 minutes)
- **Explain rules** to someone else
- **Let them play** while you observe
- **Note confusion points** and usability issues
- **Get feedback** on fun factor and clarity

## üîß Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### RFID Not Working
**Symptom:** Cards don't scan or inconsistent reading  
**Fix:** Check 3.3V connection, ensure cards are 125kHz, try different cards

### No Sound
**Symptom:** Silent operation, no beeps  
**Fix:** Check speaker polarity, verify 220Œ© resistor, test with multimeter

### Arduino Won't Boot
**Symptom:** No startup message, Serial Monitor blank  
**Fix:** Check power connections, try different USB cable, press reset button

### Wrong Country Names
**Symptom:** Scans show "Unknown" or wrong country  
**Fix:** Re-scan tokens to get actual UIDs, update code, re-upload

### Power Issues
**Symptom:** System resets randomly, poor performance  
**Fix:** Check power bank capacity, ensure 2A output, reduce LED brightness
