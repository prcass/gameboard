## üõçÔ∏è Where to Buy

### Amazon Prime (2-day delivery)
**Pros:** Fast shipping, easy returns, one-stop shopping  
**Cons:** Slightly higher prices on some components

**Arduino Kit Bundle:** Search "Arduino Uno R3 Starter Kit" - often includes breadboard, wires, resistors (~$35)

### Electronics Suppliers
- **Adafruit.com** - High quality, detailed tutorials, US-based
- **SparkFun.com** - Great learning resources, reliable components  
- **Digikey.com** - Professional grade, bulk pricing
- **Mouser.com** - Wide selection, technical datasheets

### Local Options
- **Micro Center** - In-store pickup, competitive Arduino prices
- **RadioShack** (where still open) - Basic components
- **Best Buy** - Arduino kits, USB cables, power banks
- **Walmart/Target** - Craft supplies (foam board, wooden discs)

## üì¶ Smart Shopping Tips

### Money-Saving Strategies
1. **Arduino Compatible** - "Elegoo Uno R3" works great for $15 vs $25 genuine
2. **Starter Kits** - Arduino kits include breadboard, wires, resistors
3. **Bulk RFID tags** - 50-pack vs 10-pack has better per-unit cost
4. **Local craft stores** - Wooden discs, foam board often cheaper locally

### What NOT to Cheap Out On
- **RFID Reader** - Poor quality = unreliable scanning
- **Power Bank** - Low quality = fire hazard, poor performance  
- **Jumper Wires** - Cheap wires break easily

### Free/Salvage Options
- **Speaker** - Old computer speakers, small radio, phone speaker
- **USB Cable** - Any micro-USB cable works
- **Resistors** - Salvage from old electronics
- **Wooden discs** - Cut from dowel rod with bandsaw

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools You'll Need

### Essential Tools (probably have these)
- **Computer** - Windows/Mac/Linux for Arduino IDE
- **Craft knife** - Cutting foam board, trimming labels
- **Scissors** - Cutting labels, wire stripping
- **Ruler** - Measuring cuts and component placement

### Helpful Tools
- **Soldering iron** - Permanent connections (not required for prototype)
- **Wire strippers** - Clean wire preparation
- **Multimeter** - Troubleshooting electrical issues
- **Hot glue gun** - Securing components to foam board
