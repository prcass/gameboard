## üß™ Component Testing Protocol

### Test 1: Power & LEDs (2 minutes)
**Expected:** Power LED on Arduino lights up, NeoPixel ring shows red sweep
```
Result: PASS ‚òê  FAIL ‚òê
Notes: _________________________________
```

### Test 2: Buzzer Audio (1 minute)  
**Expected:** Short beep sound from buzzer module
```
Result: PASS ‚òê  FAIL ‚òê
Notes: _________________________________
```

### Test 3: RFID Recognition (2 minutes)
**Expected:** Scan test card ‚Üí Serial Monitor shows "Card detected!" + green flash + beep
```
Result: PASS ‚òê  FAIL ‚òê
Notes: _________________________________
```

### Test 4: Multiple Cards (3 minutes)
**Expected:** Each different card/sticker produces same response
```
Card 1: PASS ‚òê  FAIL ‚òê
Card 2: PASS ‚òê  FAIL ‚òê 
Card 3: PASS ‚òê  FAIL ‚òê
Notes: _________________________________
```

## üéÆ Game Setup Phase

### NFC Sticker Programming (30 minutes)
- [ ] **Scan each sticker** with test code to get UID
- [ ] **Record UIDs** in programming log
- [ ] **Apply stickers to token bases** - Center and secure
- [ ] **Update main game code** with actual UIDs
- [ ] **Upload complete game code** to Arduino

### Token Creation (20 minutes)
- [ ] **Print country labels** on adhesive paper
- [ ] **Cut labels to size** - 1" circles or appropriate shape
- [ ] **Apply labels to tokens** - Over NFC stickers
- [ ] **Test each token** - Should announce country name (debug mode)

### Challenge Cards (15 minutes)
- [ ] **Print challenge cards** on cardstock 
- [ ] **Apply NFC stickers** to card backs
- [ ] **Record challenge UIDs** and update code
- [ ] **Test each challenge** - Should load appropriate challenge type

## üêõ Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### RFID Not Reading
**Symptoms:** No response when scanning cards
- [ ] Check 3.3V connection (not 5V)
- [ ] Verify SPI pin connections (especially SDA to pin 10)
- [ ] Try different cards/stickers
- [ ] Check for loose breadboard connections

### No Sound from Buzzer
**Symptoms:** Silent operation, no beeps
- [ ] Verify buzzer type (active vs passive)
- [ ] Check 5V power connection  
- [ ] Test with simple digitalWrite() HIGH/LOW
- [ ] Try different buzzer if available

### NeoPixel Ring Not Lighting
**Symptoms:** LEDs remain dark
- [ ] Check 5V power connection
- [ ] Verify data connection to Pin 6
- [ ] Test with simple pixel.setPixelColor() commands
- [ ] Check for proper library installation

### Arduino Won't Program
**Symptoms:** Upload errors, connection failed
- [ ] Check USB cable (try different cable)
- [ ] Verify correct board selection in Arduino IDE
- [ ] Press reset button before upload
- [ ] Disconnect power during programming

## ‚úÖ Final Readiness Check

### Before First Game Session
- [ ] **All components tested** and working
- [ ] **Game code uploaded** with correct UIDs
- [ ] **Tokens respond correctly** when scanned
- [ ] **Challenge cards load** appropriate challenges
- [ ] **Battery provides** 4+ hours runtime
- [ ] **Game flow understood** - scan challenge ‚Üí scan tokens ‚Üí get feedback

### Success Criteria Met
- [ ] **RFID scanning feels magical** - instant response
- [ ] **Audio feedback is clear** and helpful
- [ ] **Visual feedback is dramatic** - green success, red failure
- [ ] **Press-your-luck tension** builds with each scan
- [ ] **Family/friends want to play again** after demo

## üéØ Ready to Play!

**Congratulations!** You've built a working RFID prototype that demonstrates:

‚úÖ **Immediate feedback** - Each scan gives instant audio/visual response  
‚úÖ **Press-your-luck mechanics** - Risk/reward with each additional scan  
‚úÖ **Educational content** - Real country data with ranking challenges  
‚úÖ **Authentic feel** - Just like scanning with a real RFID scanner  

**Game Experience:**
1. **Scan challenge card** ‚Üí Blue pulse + beep (challenge loaded)
2. **Scan country token** ‚Üí Yellow spinning + rapid beeps (processing)
3. **Wait for result** ‚Üí Green flash + happy beep (correct) OR Red flash + sad beep (wrong)
4. **Press your luck** ‚Üí Continue scanning or bank points by scanning challenge card again

**Next Steps:**
- Test with family and friends
- Gather feedback on user experience  
- Document what works and what needs improvement
- Use learnings to refine the manufacturing design

**You've successfully proven the concept! üéâ**
