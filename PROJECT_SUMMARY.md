# GameBoard RFID Oracle Game - Complete Project Summary

## 🎮 Final Game Concept

**Game Name:** GameBoard Oracle  
**Genre:** Press-Your-Luck Trivia with Physical Components  
**Target Price:** $69.99 CAD retail  
**Players:** 2-6 players  
**Age:** 10+ years  

### Core Gameplay
- Players take turns scanning NFC tokens on the Oracle
- Each scan reveals if their choice is CORRECT or WRONG for current ranking
- "Press Your Luck" mechanics: continue for more points or pass to bank current score
- Wrong answer = lose all points, next player's turn
- Scan challenge card again to bank accumulated points

## 💰 Manufacturing Economics

### At 2,000 Units (Realistic Launch Scale)

**Oracle Assembly:**
- Electronics: $9
- Housing (pyramid): $2
- Assembly (Vietnam): $5
- **Oracle Total: $16**

**Game Components:**
- 30 round NFC tokens: $7.50
- 30 CR80 NFC cards: $9.00
- Printing/graphics: $2.50
- Packaging: $3.00
- **Components Total: $22**

**Direct Sourcing Savings:** -$2
**Total Manufacturing:** $38
**Shipping to Canada:** $8
**Total Landed Cost:** $46

### Profitability at $69.99 CAD Retail

- **Big Box (35% markup):** $52 wholesale - $46 cost = **$6 profit**
- **Amazon (25% markup):** $56 wholesale - $46 cost = **$10 profit**
- **Game Stores (50% markup):** $47 wholesale - $46 cost = **$1 profit**

**Result:** Profitable across all major channels at 2,000 units

## 🚀 Expansion Strategy

### Expansion Pack Format
**Each pack contains:**
- 30 round NFC tokens (new category)
- 30 CR80 challenge cards
- **Manufacturing:** $12.50 at scale
- **Retail:** $24.99-29.99 CAD

### Planned Categories
1. **Base Game:** Countries & Geography
2. **Movies & TV Shows**
3. **Sports & Athletes**
4. **Music & Artists**
5. **History & Leaders**
6. **Science & Nature**

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### Technology Choices
- ✅ **RFID over alternatives** (resistors, magnets, QR codes)
- ✅ **13.56MHz NFC** (NTAG215/MIFARE Classic)
- ✅ **No app required** - standalone device
- ✅ **Arduino-based** for simplicity and cost

### Design Decisions
- ✅ **Truncated pyramid Oracle** over cube or sphere
- ✅ **Mixed tokens/cards** over all-cards or all-tokens
- ✅ **Press-your-luck gameplay** over pure ranking
- ✅ **Single scanning position** over multiple positions

### Business Model
- ✅ **Base unit + expansions** (proven model)
- ✅ **$69.99 CAD** price point for base
- ✅ **2,000 unit initial production** (realistic scale)
- ✅ **Vietnam assembly** for cost savings

## ⚠️ Cost Optimization Strategies Applied

1. **Arduino Clone:** $3 vs $6 original
2. **12-LED ring:** $3 vs $5 for 20-LED
3. **Vietnam Assembly:** $5 vs $8 in China
4. **Direct Component Sourcing:** Save $2 per unit
5. **Efficient Packaging:** Digital rules via QR code
6. **7×7×3 Oracle:** Smaller than original 8×8×4 plan

## 📊 Market Position

### Competitive Advantages
- ✅ **Unique pyramid Oracle design** - no direct competitors
- ✅ **Physical + digital hybrid** without app dependency
